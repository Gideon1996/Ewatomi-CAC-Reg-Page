          is, some of them are aware of it while some are of the pinion that it
          is not important since the business or company has been registered
          with Corporate Affairs Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, you’ll know everything you need to know about CAC

        </ul>

        <h3>What is CAC annual return?</h3>
        <p>
          Like the name implies, “annual return”, it is a document or a payment
          that is been filed at once a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAC annual return is a report that businesses or companies must send
          to government each year by giving particular details, for example, the
          name of business owner, name of company directors, address and details
          of assets and shares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Annual return is what will make CAC understands that the business
          still exists. CAC annual return is been filled every year.
        </p>

        <h3>Who is to file annual return?</h3>

        <p>
          This is another important question that you’ll want to know as many
          entities don’t know who is to file annual return. CAC annual return is
          not for everyone, it is not for all businesses or companies. CAC
          annual return is only for those who have a registered entity with
          Corporate Affairs Commission. If you have a business, company,
          incorporated trustee, or religious organization registered with CAC,
          it is mandatory for you to file your annual return. So, if you fall in
          any of the aforementioned, it is compulsory for you to file annual
          return. Annual return is not optional, it is compulsory for all
          registered entity.

          <div class="disadvantage">
            <h3>Disadvantages of not filing annual return</h3>

            <p>
              You might be wondering, what might actually be the disadvantages
              for not filing your CAC annual return. There are some
              disadvantages attach to not filing it which are;
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                According to the Company and Allied Matters Act as amended 2020
                (CAMA 2020), failure to file annual returns for a consecutive
                period of 10 years is a ground for striking off the name of such
                entity from CAC register. The commission will believe that such
                business or company does not exist anymore. Hence, the
                commission will strike off the name which means the certificate
                is no more useful.
              </li>
              <li>
                The commission will notify the general public by publishing
                those names in at least 3 national newspapers that the said
                entity has been strike off and nobody should engage in
                whatsoever businesses or transactions with them again.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is late penalty for not filling it at the right time. It
                must not be delayed. It must be done at least once in a year.
              </li>
              <li>
                The name won’t be available for registration after it has been
                strike off. i.e. the proprietor won’t be able to register such
                name again unless the annual return is been filled up to date.
              </li>
              <li>
                It will be a disgrace to the entity for not filing annual return
                and allowing CAC to strike it off.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="advantage">
            <h3>Advantages of filing annual return</h3>

            <p>
              Will you even get anything in return if you file your annual
              return? Below are some of the advantages.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>It makes you a law abiding citizen</li>
              <li>
                It helps the commission to understand that such entity still
                exists.
              </li>
              <li>
                It allows you to have access to some government benefits such as
                survival funds, loan contract and many more.
              </li>
              <li>
                It saves time whenever such entity wants to do any post
                incorporation. Post incorporation is any registration that is
                done after an entity has been registered. For example, upgrading
                from a business name to Limited Liability Company or Non
                Governmental Organizations.
              </li>
              <li>
                When annual return is been paid at the right time, you won’t pay
                for penalty fee, which means you’ll pay less to those who have
                default.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          In conclusion, filing of annual return is good for your registered
          entity; it is the one that allows CAC to determine your consistency in
          business. Once you file it, you’re safe. If you default for 10 years,
          your entity would be strike off. CAC annual return is to be filed once
          in a year.

          <a name="benefit of registring">BENEFITS</a> OF REGISTERING YOUR
          BUSINESS WITH CORPORATE AFFAIRS COMMISSION
        </h3>

        <p>
          Anyone can decide one day to start operating a business. All that the
          person needs to do is provide a product or service to another person
          in exchange for money or money’s worth to be “in business.” While
          registering your business with the” Corporate Affairs Commission”
          (CAC) isn’t necessarily required to complete certain business
          transactions, it is a smart choice for new and existing entrepreneurs
          for a variety of reasons which includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Certificate of incorporation by corporate affairs commission (CAC).
            <p>
              Upon registration of a business, the commission issues a
              certificate of incorporation to the business owner evidencing that
              such business has been registered. Registering your business gives
              you the right to operate that business. Also, the certificate of
              incorporation provides a small business in Nigeria with a good
              reputation as well as legal recognition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Opening Business Bank Accounts
            <p>
              You need to provide proof that your business is properly
              registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to open a
              business bank account in Nigeria. A business bank account is an
              important asset to a small business because you can separate your
              personal activities from your business activities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Safeguarding Your Business / Corporate Name
            <p>
              One huge advantage of registration with the Corporate Affairs
              Commission (CAC) is safeguarding your business name from being
              used by another person / business. No one else can register a
              business with that same name or a similar name.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal Liability Protection
            <p>
              Another benefit of registration is receiving some legal liability
              protection (note that a private company limited by share has a
              legal personality distinct from that of its subscribers). If you
              register or incorporate your business, you will not be held
              personally responsible for certain accidents and other liabilities
              incurred by the registered company.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting Loans
            <p>
              When you apply for business loans, you’re going to have to prove
              that you’re actually a business. Banks and investors will ask to
              see your business registration certificate along with other
              application requirements before approving your loan application.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reputation with Customers
            <p>
              Customers and clients, especially people you’ve never worked with
              before, need assurance that you are a legitimate business. A
              potential client may suspect your business of being a
              “fly-by-night” operation if your company isn’t properly
              registered. When a business is registered with the Corporate
              Affairs Commission (CAC), it could put your clients at ease when
              making a decision about whether to spend money with / transact
              business with your company.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Supplier Arrangements / Government Contracts
            <p>
              A registered business also makes you eligible to receive supplier
              discounts that you wouldn’t normally receive as an unregistered
              business entity. Suppliers usually reserve special rates for
              business owners who can show official evidence of business name or
              company registration (certificate of incorporation) issued by the
              Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Also, if your plan is to be
              getting government contracts for your company, a business
              registration is one of the first requirements.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Perpetual Succession / Continuity
            <p>
              Another benefits of registration your business with Corporate
              Affairs Commission is the business continuing even if you die or
              become ill. A registered business is an entity in its own right;
              thus, another can assume ownership or control or your business can
              be sold. Neither is it possible without registration.
